## About

Every year, millions of people die prematurely from air pollution related deaths, including 1.7 million children. Exposure to poor air quality has been linked to asthma & cardiovascular diseases such as strokes, heart disease, and even cancer. Air pollution is the world's largest single environmental health risk. If reducing air pollution could save our children & millions of lives, why don't we care more?

Introducing this project. We want to provide a solution to the world where every person can find out what their surrounding air quality is like and how it impacts them. We need this solution to be affordable, portable, accurate, and integrated with a smart device.
Green energy is more than just about reducing climate change or improving economic sustainability. It's about maintaining the health of our communities and the health of our children. If we can successfully bridge this gap, then we all collectively win.

## Features

- Ability to retrieve air quality summary from [airnow.gov](https://airnow.gov) and [aqicn.org](aqicn.org) for the current region you are in. The regional summary includes overall air quality index score and a list of all major pollutant and their concentration levels.
- Info on air quality index, pollution types, and actionable tips.
- Ability to retrieve air quality forecast data for the next 5 days.
- Can show all air quality monitoring sites on the map from any city around the world.
- Ability to notify you when air quality is unhealthy and also the daily air quality alert.
